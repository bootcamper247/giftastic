# GifTastic
## HTML/CSS/JQuery/API

- Here's how the app works:

- When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

- When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gifs animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

- Each Image has its rating displayed above it.

- The user can enter value to a user input box and that button also gets added to the page.
